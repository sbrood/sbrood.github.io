I am a PhD Student under the supervision of [Alexandre d'Aspremont](https://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/) and [Philippe Ciais](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=PJhqfAoAAAAJ&hl=fr). I am part of the [SIERRA](https://sierra-mlopt.github.io/team/) team (ENS/INRIA/CNRS), working on the AI4Forests project.

My research focuses on developing new deep learning techniques to analyze and predict forest properties using remote sensing data. Currently, I am particularly interested in creating temporal based models to capture and retrieve time-based forest characteristics such as tree genuses or phenology.

By combining machine learning techniques with ecological data, my work aims to contribute to climate change mitigation efforts and promote sustainable forest management.
